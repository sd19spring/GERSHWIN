# Our Project

Have you ever had a lyric running through your head, but just couldn’t find a melody to match? Now with Gershwin™ you can type in the lyric, select a genre, and listen for your own custom made random tune! Gershwin™ will take your lyric, analyze its tone, and return a melody in a key to match, in your chosen genre.
