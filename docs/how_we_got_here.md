### How We Got Here

## Successes & Failures

_Successes_

* We were able to generate music that matches a given genre fairly well
* minamilstic, appealing aethetic 

_Failures_

* Integration within one output area (annie what do you mean)
* Can't match notes to syllable breakdown

## The Process

We designed the front and back end code simultaneously

_Front End_

We started by creating a scene in pygame and generating boxes to use as buttons. We then added a piece to the program that allowed us to click the buttons we created, and inverted the colors of the buttons that were being hovered over. 

_Back End_

To get the back end running, we had to learn how to run Music21, a python music library, and create dictionaries for notes, keys, chords, and genres.
